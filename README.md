# blam_inflater
A tool to decompress various Halo files.

This tool was created to inflate (or decompress) some files that Halo 3 uploads to Bungie's web services.
However, it should suite any file compressed via the `runtime_data_compress` function in Halo 3 and Reach. I have not checked older games.

To use the tool, simply provide your compressed file path as an arguemnt, and it will be inflated in place.
